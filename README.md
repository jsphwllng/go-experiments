# A place for me to document my Go learnings
<p>My end goal is to write a program that will take a photograph through a webcam daily and then upload this picture to instagram. I have a long way to "go" before this though.</p>

## Thoughts on Go

* having to declare the types of parameters and the return type is pretty interesting
* defer is a good concept and could make human-reading functions a bit quicker
* the &variable and *variable pointers are interesting but it seems to boil down to scope which is always annoying
